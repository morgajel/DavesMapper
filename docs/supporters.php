        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
          <p>Dave's Mapper started out as an improvement on the mappers made by <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/" target="_blank">Rob Lang</a>. When I noticed that wide maps broke across lines rather than being the proper size, I wrote a line or two of code that could fix it, as well as a few lines to randomly rotate tiles for an extra feature.</p>
          <p>Shortly thereafter, I came up with my own set of tiles and thought it would be fun to make my own mapper for my tiles; one that would fix some of the issues and add the features not present in Rob's mappers. I soon asked a few other tile artists if they would be interested in having their tiles featured, and off I went building this mapper you see here. The support from the community has been awesome and I can't thank everyone enough!</p>

				<h2 id="dice"><a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorph Dice</a></h2>
					<p>The awesome concept and planning by Joe Wetzel of Inkwell Ideas turned into the <a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorph Dice</a> project. I'm glad to have been a part of it, and happy that the mapper played a small role in bringing together some of the contributors to his project. Check out the dice, cards, font, and other cool stuff Joe is making with map tiles over at <a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorphs.com</a>.</p>

				<h2 id="donors">Donors</h2>
					<p>In early 2011, Dave's Mapper had a funding drive to get $200 for the costs of putting the mapper on a new domain and hosting plan. Thank you to all of the donors who helped reach the $200 goal and helped keep Dave's Mapper up and running for the next 3 years!</p>
				<h2 id="sandwiches">Tasty Sandwiches</h2>
					<p>Lots of people help me keep going by donating so I can get a tasty sub sandwich. (I used to get burgers, but sub sandwiches are tastier and better for you.) Here's a gallery of the sandwiches I've enjoyed so far:</p>

					<p>As of 2012, I'm no longer asking for sandwich donations. Instead, I'm asking for any amount you'd like to give toward my personal medical expenses and/or donations toward the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Links for those are in the footer.</p>
