						<p>Dave here. In 2011, shortly after getting the mapper really rolling, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is a pretty awful condition where your budy starts attacking your colon. It's not fun stuff. I started treatment to help fix things, but ultimately a bad flare-up of my symptoms led to going to the emergency room. I was hospitalized on September 14, 2011, and on September 21 I lost my colon.</p>

						<p>As the anniversary of my hopsital stay approaches, I decided I wanted to do a project to benefit an organization that helps those affected by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). As new advancements continue to be made in the medical field, it's more important than ever to support organizations like the <a href="http://ccfa.org">Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA)</a>.</p>
						<p>From September 14-25, many of your favorite RPG cartographers will be pledging new tiles for the mapper based on your donations. A donation as simple as $5 means $5 closer to curing IBD, and 5 or more tiles added to the mapper to boot.</p>
						<h3>Contributors</h3>
						<p>Here are the lovely, awesome contributors pledging their tile-making talent to help IBD:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Dave:</strong> How could I not participate in my own project? I'll pledge 1 tile for every $5 donated.</li>
							<li><strong>BillDaKat:</strong> Ever the city-lover, BillDaKat pledges to match my tiles 1 to 1 with city edges.</li>
							<li><strong>Dominic Toghill:</strong> Dominic is also pledging to match my tiles 1 to 1.</li>
							<li><strong>Dyson Logos:</strong> Still in his own recovery mode, Dyson has still pledged to help. He'll be creating 1 tile for every $25 donated.</li>
							<li><strong>Fr. Dave:</strong> Fr. Dave (who has a great name, by the way) is also matching my tiles 1 to 1.</li>
							<li><strong>Brutus Motor:</strong> Always up for an adventure, Brutus Motor has also pledged to match my tiles 1 to 1.</li>
							<li><strong>bygrinstow:</strong> Diving in head first, newer contributor bygrinstow has also pledged to match my tiles 1 to 1.</li>
