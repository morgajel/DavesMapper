Dave's Mapper
=============

This is the code behind [Dave's Mapper](http://davesmapper.com). It's based on the Morph Mapper by Rob Lang, but pretty much everything beyond the initial concept stage was written by David Millar. Now it's being open-sourced to make development a bit easier and more betterer.
